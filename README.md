# Animal Searcher Tool

## This is a fun project I made inspired from a project I made at university, and decided to expand on it by adding a background image and using JavaScript to allow images to show up to animals the user searches for.

## Software used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code
